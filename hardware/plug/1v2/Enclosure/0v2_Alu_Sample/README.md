### In this version 0v2

I will try a different approach for placing pcb in enclosure. I will use wider enclosure due to issues of only narrow sideband available on LimeSDR PCB (slightly more than 1mm). 

I ordered 76 mm and 94 mm wide enclosures of 35 and 40 mm height. Length stays same 100 mm. New samples are also split design (bottom and top part)
